                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>The history of the Lutz Rafting Co dates back to just yesterday.  It is a start up company and we have amazing
                    sponsers that are just as excited to run the river and provide wonderful things for this community.  There has
                    been a lot of time and energy collecting data about this river and we are sure that we have the best location.  
                    Best campgrounds and most amazing rapids at all levels.  We are excited to jump into this great adventure.
